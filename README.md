# WeatherDashboard
* Simple Reactive Weather Dashboard

## Description
I created a simple weather dashboard with bootstrap for layout, Open Weather's api (utilizing a couple AJAX calls for UV Index, forecast, and current), I wanted to try something new so I used https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date for the date/time format, and JQuery using simple variables, a few loops, simple functions, and click/event handlers.
* Put the whole script into an document.ready function
* set variable for searched city at the top and then the rest of my variables.
* function to check local storage to see if searched for city is there
* set up API key and URL
* make/create AJAX call for current weather
* parse and display results
* functions to get and display UV Index
* functions to get and display 5 day forecast
* function to add searched for city to history
* function to display history
* function to clear history from local storage
* event handlers to search, clear, display and reload last searched info on page with refresh/reload.

## Uses
Use as a traveler to check weather for your destinations. Or just for anyone that wants to keep track of the weather.
